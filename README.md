In this study, 20 wild mice were collected from the Gyirong Basin in Tibet, China, and 12 from Sudurpashchim, Nepal. Combined with previously published mouse data, a total of 164 individuals were analyzed. Phylogenetic and genetic structure analyses based on different types of genomic markers classified the individuals from the Gyirong Basin into a new lineage of the house mouse, designated M. m. gyirongus.
